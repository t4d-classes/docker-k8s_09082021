# Exercise #4 - Push Image to Docker Hub

K8s Note: In this lab, you are pushing to the public Docker Hub registry. Later, in the K8s part of the course, you will be pushing to a MicroK8s privately hosted repository. Tagging and pushing an image is an important skill in K8s.

## Steps

1. Log into Docker Hub from the command line. Remember, you will need an access token from the Docker Hub web site to use as a password. Tokens can be retrieved from Account Settings -> Security on the Docker Hub web site. Save this token for future use.

2.  Push the `ubuntu-nginx-php-demo` image from the previous lab exercise. Be sure to push the version tagged with your account name.

3. Review the Docker Hub web site to view the public page for the image your pushed.

4. Remove the image from Docker Hub through the "settings" of the repository.

5. Logout out of Docker Hub with the Docker command line tool.

### Excellent Job! You have completed the lab exercise!
